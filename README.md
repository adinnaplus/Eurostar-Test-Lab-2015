# Eurostar-Test-Lab-2015

## Introduction and a bit of history
More and more people organize test labs at different conferences. The first Test Lab was set up in 2009 by James Lyndsay and Bart Knaack. They sought advice from many, including Stuart Noakes (who sponsored TCL’s Zappers events) and Mieke Gievers. Read more about it here http://www.developsense.com/blog/2009/12/eurostars-test-lab-bravo/. Some more stuff about the history in this “Karlskrona Test Gathering” presentation http://www.karlskronatestgathering.se/presentations/ktg1/Real_Testing_at_a_Test_Conference.pptx. 

## Finding a TestLab
The TestLab started at EuroSTAR09. James and Bart have done multiple TestLabs at subsequent EuroSTAR, STAREast, STARWest and AgileTestingDays, together and separately. James, Martin and Ru have done TestLabs at Let’s Test. Ru, Maaret and Adina did some at BTD (Belgium Testing Days, or under the new name Business, Testing and Development). James did a one-man TestLab at CAST and a couple of UK things, Bart did a one-man TestLab at various others.

## Current TestLab events and crews
No guarantees, but it looks like (in Feb 2015) EuroSTAR, ATD, Let’s Test (and Tasting Let’s Test Benelux), Belgium Testing Days and about half of {STAREast, STARWest} conferences want ongoing TestLabs. EuroSTAR has a rolling program of apprentices, this year’s Let’s Test is Martin and Ru, Paul Carvalho and Wade Wachs did one with James and now are the primary people for STAREast/West, and Bart and James still do ATD together when they can. It’s foolishly hard to do with one person – and the more central the space, and the more people helping, the more people get testing.

## Purpose of the test lab
People to learn by doing hands on testing.

## How it does that
By supplying a physical and technical environment that helps people to get testing – so all the work of environment setup, tool setup, kit, friendly faces, quick tests and deep tests, logins, test goals, charters, available data, bug logging system, code browsing, config management, test scripts, requirements tracing and so on has been already done. Of course, plenty of testing involves exactly this, so there’s always scope to do more. And James doesn’t think we’ve ever done all of these at once, and can’t recall any TestLab where people have asked for (or been able to get) traceable requirements.

## Learning objective
Whatever software or hardware exercises are being done in the test lab it’s important that they are accompanied by a learning objective in relationship to testing. E.g the black boxes don’t bring much value without debriefing. 

## Test Lab Crew’s role 
Facilitate the learning of the participants (guiding them). Set up the environment, and keep the underlying system up and running. Help experts, novices, quiet people, loud people, dabblers and committed TestLab participants to get as much as they can without getting in each other’s way too much.

## Open source projects
We choose (as much as possible) to test open source or free software. Open source projects, by definition, allow access the source code, giving a selection of potential approaches that would be unavailable with closed-source. Projects (such as those on github) that open-source through change control also allow interested testers to see what changed and when, who made the change, and (sometimes) why a change was made, which provides a further set of approaches. Some open source projects have open bug lists, an instrumented dev branch, coverage metrics, and automated unit and acceptance testing – each of these, again, gives scope for alternative test approaches. Other powerful reasons to choose opensource include; no licence fee, no need to seek permission, and potentially to support and help TestLab target products by logging bugs to the project, and occasionally enthusing a tester enough to join the effort.

When it comes to tools, we again look for open source or free tools rather than paid ones. It’s helpful if participants can start using the tools when they go back home without needing to pay for them. However, depending on event, the TestLab can be a revenue resource for the organisers. Sponsorship from vendors was a necessary part of most of James + Bart’s early TestLabs.
